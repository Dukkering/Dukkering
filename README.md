- Hello, my name is Jeff
- I am currently in the process of building up my profile and repositories with projects I've worked on and completed
- So far, I have been studying Java and JavaScript, with some Python on the side. I'm also familiar with HTML and CSS,though admittedly out of date at this time (9-18-2024)

Dukkering/Dukkering is a ✨ special ✨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.
You can click the Preview link to take a look at your changes.
